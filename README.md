# semantic-html
An example of semantic HTML where I clean up the HTML and css

## Description

Given the starter code I had writen discriptions for each semantic, fixed the bug in which you were unable to go to the Search Engine Optimization, cleaned the extra spaces and unnessisary lines, added alts to all the images for accesibility, and removed repeating lines in the css.
